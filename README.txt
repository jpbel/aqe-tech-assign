Part 1: the castle company

	The castles at peaks are marked by 'C^' and the castles at vallies are marked by 'Cv'. Any place with no castle is marked by null.

Part 2: the transformation company

	Split the bots into their teams so no bot can face a duplicate of itself. 

	If Optimus Prime and Predaking face off the function prints "World Distroyed, everyone is dead..."

	If the win totals are the same the function prints "It's a tie!"
